Fullstack web application for the INFS3202 course

This application is purposed as a discussion forum. It takes heavy inspiration for the Edstem web app.
This app allows for users to post threads and have other users reply to them
Instructors (moderators) have to ability to approve answers if they feel that they properly answer the question
Instructors also have the ability to delete the post replies of a user if they feel that the reply should not remain on the site
Users also have the ability to rate other users' posts
